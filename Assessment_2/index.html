   HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language used for creating web pages and applications on the internet. It is the backbone of every web page, providing the structure and organization of its content. HTML uses a hierarchical structure of tags to define the various elements on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, forms, and more. By using HTML, developers can create text-based documents that are displayed in browsers and enable the interpretation and rendering of different elements to create visually appealing and interactive web pages. It acts as a foundation for other web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript, allowing for the separation of document structure, presentation, and behavior.

    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe how HTML elements should be displayed on a web page. It provides a way to control the layout, design, and visual styling of web content. With CSS, developers can define properties such as color, font, size, spacing, positioning, and more for individual elements or groups of elements. By separating the presentation layer from the content layer (defined by HTML), CSS allows for greater flexibility and consistency in styling multiple web pages. CSS also supports responsive design, enabling web pages to adapt and adjust their layout based on different devices and screen sizes. It plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal, user experience, and overall aesthetics of websites and web applications.
